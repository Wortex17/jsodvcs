Jsodvcs (**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **D**istributed **V**ersion **C**ontrol **S**ystem) 
gives users the possibility to store javascript objects and other native
types in a repository, commit, stage and discard changes, create branches and pull and merge
commits/changes from other repositories. It works completely in-memory in javascript and does
not depend on or require any specific form of text-based serialization or even a file system
at all!  
*(Though, some form of serilization is recommended should you want to store or transmit
the repositories over the wire. Jsodvc tries to make this process as easy as possbile for you)*
